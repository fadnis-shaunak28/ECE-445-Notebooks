## Week 1 (2/5)
Objective of the Week: The objective of this week was to discuss with my group members what we should design for our project. Objectively, I want to ensure that the projects will meet all the requirements for hardware and software components, as well as outline what I have demonstrated as an engineers throughout my curiculum.

Tasks Accomplished:
- This week I met with my team members Navin and Shaunak to decide on a final project. We all outlined our strengths and weaknesses to see what project goals best suit us. Since I prefer working with software and firmware, I proposed the idea of a bluetooth burner which incorperated all software, firmware, and hardware components.
- I also met with my TA, Zicheng, to discuss project goals and how the outlook of the semester will go. We also outlined meeting times and other responsibilities that my group and I am to follow, such as high level requirements, lab notebooks, and due dates. 
- Towards the end of the week, we began filling out the project proposal on the course website. While doing this, I took the time to research more about our project and sketch and brief outline of the high level component structure. Additionally, we made sure to answer any questions asked by professor.

Goals for the following week:
- Begin writing design document and researching subsystems involved with the bluetooth burner.
- Investigate parts and potential methods for design and verification, especially regarding bluetooth connectivity and heating.
## Week 2 (2/13)

Objective of the Week: The objective of this week was to contribute to writing the design document for the Bluetooth burner. This included starting the initial drafts of the design document, while also investigating potential methods for design and verification.

Tasks Accomplished:
- This week I got a chance to look at our prosal and review them with Zicheng along with some comments from Professor Gruev. Some of these comments included a higher level block diagram which included more labeling for I/O pins as well as chart labels.
- Additioanlly, I looked at parts that would be helpful for constructing our bluetooth burner. This included the arduino/microcontroller of choice: ESP32, and the test kit: ESP32- Dev Board. While doing this I also made sure to investigate alternatives such as Arduino Nano	or ESP8266, but the trade offs in bluetooth for processing power did not seem feasable.

Goals for the follow week:
- One thing that we were not able to do this week was begin working on our PCB. This was primarily due to us still figuring out what parts we want to use for the rest of the bluetooth burner.
- Gather materials such as ESP 32 dev kit so that I can begin working on software components. One responsibility that I took on was working on the control and sofware subsystems. 
## Week 3 (2/19)
Objective of the Week: My goal this week was to continue to work on our design document for the upcoming design review,. My team and I aimed to finalize the parts list that we will use and get it approved during the design document. Lastly, I also want to begin designing front-end with Navin. 

Tasks Accomplished:
- This week I spent more time working on the design document and preparing for the design review. This included spending hours with Shaunak and Navin on PCB design as well as finsihing our final list for part orders. 
- One question that Shaunak and I had to ask during office hours was the best methods of heating/cooling. Jason explained to us that the best ways to implement our heating and cooling on the PCB is using a buck converter, so we looked up parts and implementation methods for them

Goals for  the following week:
- This week I did not get as much time as I wanted to to work on the front end part of the project. After the design document, I aim to work on the software component on the dev board or in XCode desigining the app.
- Finish PCB design with Shaunak and Navin and try to get it verified. 
## Week 4 (2/26)
- Completed design review with Professor Viktor Gruev
- Improved upon overall design from design review. This included schematic adjustments such as [Include Changes]
- Started working on PCB with Shaunak
## Week 5 (3/4)
- Started building bluetooth burner application in swift
- Reviewed Design Doc with mentor for finalization
## Week 6 (Spring Break)

## Week 7
- Finished iphone application front end
- Started working on ESP 32 protocols and bluetooth communication
