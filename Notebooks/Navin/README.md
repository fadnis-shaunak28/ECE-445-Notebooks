## Week 1 (2/5)
Objective of the Week: Build off of our initial project proposal post and complete our RFA Proposal

Tasks Accomplished:
- Met with my team members, Varun and Shaunak, to work on completing RFA in a timely and satisfactory manner
- Also met with our TA, Zicheng Ma, for our first weekly meeting to discuss important details for our semester such as lab notebooks, deadlines, and goals for our project
- Worked on understanding requirements and design specifications for the sensor and software subsystems of our product
- Worked on a tolerance analysis using specific heat capacity equation (as follows):

\begin{align*}
    $\text{Area} &= L \times W = 0.1\,\text{m} \times 0.1\,\text{m} = 0.01\,\text{m}^2 \\
    \text{Volume} &= \text{Area} \times \text{Thickness} = 0.01\,\text{m}^2 \times 0.002\,\text{m} = 0.00002\,\text{m}^3 \\
    m &= \rho \times \text{Volume} = 2500\,\text{kg/m}^3 \times 0.00002\,\text{m}^3 = 0.05\,\text{kg} \\
    Q &= mc\Delta T = 0.05\,\text{kg} \times 1000\,\text{J/(kgÂ°C)} \times 30\,^\circ\text{C} = 1500\,\text{J}$
\end{align*}

## Week 2 (2/12)

Objective of the Week: Beginning the final draft of our design document highlighting design schematics, requirements and verifications, and cost analysis 

Tasks Accomplished:
- In our weekly meeting with TA Zicheng, we received feedback and discussed things to build off of from our RFA Proposal as we continued to work on our design document
- Assisted in creating the sensor schematic, finding our parts and details regarding labor costs, fine-tuning our high-level requirements as it pertains to our product design goals.

## Week 3 (2/19)
Objective of the Week: Complete the design document, start guaging how to go about PCB schematic and implementation of key subsystem components

Tasks Accomplished:
- Finished our final list for part orders and began looking into PCB design
- Met with TA Zicheng to address questions we had regarding design document features as well as ideas for our subsystem implementations
- Looked into safety and ethic protocols that were mandatory in for marketing/using our product (IEEE Code of Ethics)

## Week 4 (2/26)
Objective of the Week: Improve upon design document, prepare for design review, and revisit RFA Proposal to make revisions based on feedback and design document content. Also looked into (briefly) working on software application for product

Tasks Accomplished:
- Design review with Professor Gruev. Professor mentioned was using a P-Type mosfet and buck converter to allow for power to pass through to our heating subsystem in a more efficient manner. Also emphasized importance of feedback loop consideration within our product 
- Began looking into developing the software with Varun. We met up and started outlining the design for the front-end in Xcode.
- Made the necessary changes to our RFA based on updated block diagram and fine-tuning of high-level requirements and R&V table
  
## Week 5 (3/4)
Objective of the Week: Have parts ordered and begin working in Xcode to develop Swift iOS mobile application.

Tasks Accomplished:
- Completed team evaluation to help course staff and Professors guage member involvement
- Varun and I added button inputs and event listeners for the Swift mobile app
- Lighter week as I prepared to head home for spring break

## Week 6 (Spring Break 3/11)
